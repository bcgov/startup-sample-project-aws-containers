                The encryptFolder.gpg attachment contains the test results. To view them you need  to

                Decrypt the file with the following command


                    **gpg -d --batch --passphrase PASSPHRASE encryptFolder.gpg > testResults.zip**


                Where PASSPHRASE is the password you will receive in a second email, hyphen, and your License Plate, like


                    **EmailedPassword-LicensePlate**


                As example, if the emailed password in the following email is **HauCyjM8fxc** and your license plate is **ab1cde** the passphrase to decrypt the file will be


                    **HauCyjM8fxc-ab1cde**


                Note - gpg is not installed by default in all OS. You may need to download the appropriate version from https://gnupg.org/
